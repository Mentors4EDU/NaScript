NaScript which might stand for *Not Average Script* or (something else), is a new programming language made by the maker of the experimental languages [LonScript](https://github.com/Lonero-Team/LonScript) and [ScrubScript](https://github.com/Mentors4EDU/ScrubScript). NaScript is built for modern web development, micro services, and a wide variety of usecases. 

NaScript can also be used for things such as hot key automation, running regular expressions, and even setting up database macros and various forms of parsing. Game development should also be a breeze with NaScript. As a language, NaScript is very robust.
